Andorra was never on my travel list, and visiting it was a rather opportunistic decision. My wife and I were visiting Barcelona for a scientific conference where I was going to give a talk. After the conference, I wanted to show her the Pyrenees mountains. However, I had been to the Pyrenees east of Barcelona a year before. Hence, I chose Andorra for a change. I was also a better choice because it is dotted with many alpine lakes, which I thought my newlywed wife would have liked to see.

<h3>Trails</h3>
<p> Pessons lakes, Tristaina lakes, and the Incles valley.</p>

<h3>Food</h3>
<p>Andorra is rather small and food options are rather limited. Although quality of food produce in supermarkets was pretty good.</p>

<h3>Transportation</h3>
<p>Hitchhiking was straightforward, even as a couple. We hitchhiked 4-5 times in the country, and it was always a nice experience. Public transportation was good quality but limited given the mountainous terrain and low population density of the country.</p>

<h3>People</h3>
<p>I think the people of Andorra were lovely. They seemed happy and content with their life. While hitchhiking, people genuinely cared for us reaching our destination safely and sometimes went the extra mile to drop us near our home.</p>

<h3>Special Experiences</h3>
<p>The Incles valley was a gem, too beautiful to be true. The journey between Barcelona and Andorra is also beautiful, and you will pass by many Catalan hamlets.</p>
