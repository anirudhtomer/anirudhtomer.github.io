I traveled to Israel to be part of a Biostatistics conference as a PhD student. My flight tickets and stay in Jerusalem were sponsored by the conference organizers. My wife joined me on this trip and together we explored Jerusalem and Eilat over 2 weeks. The Israeli desert Negev is spectacular and I would love to see it again.

<h3>Trails</h3>
<p> Red Canyon near Eilat</p>

<h3>Food</h3>
<p>Food in Israel was delicious. Sometimes it was as cheap as eastern Europe and sometimes as expensive as western Europe. At the end of the trip the food that I still remember the most is the humble hummus of Abu Shukri in old Jerusalem. Old Jerusalem has plenty of food gems. I wish to visit it again.</p>

<h3>Transportation</h3>
<p>Required having an Israeli bus pass which could only be recharged in some shops. It was a pain in that sense. Thankfully the bus drivers never cared much about us not having the pass.</p>

<h3>People</h3>
<p>In old Jerusalem it was very easy to make friendly conversations. Having Indian looks helped as everyone knew something about Bollywood. Palestinians and Israelis both treated us with respect and love. Overall Israelis were a fun bunch as long as you did not come in the way of the security.</p>

<h3>Special Experiences</h3>
<p>Food in Jerusalem left us speechless. Hiking in red canyon made me fall in love with the desert. Besides from there I could have a nice view into Egypt's Sinai as well.</p>
