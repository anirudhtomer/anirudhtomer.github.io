I visited Portugal with a close friend Akshat, while my wife was visiting her family in India. The island of Madeira, also known as the Pearl of the Atlantic was on my travel list for quite some time. However, we reached Madeira in the middle of a week long tempest and spent most of our time hiking in fairly rough weather.

<h3>Trails</h3>
<p> Multiple trails in Madeira and Sintra (mainland) </p>

<h3>Food</h3>
<p> Local seafood in Madeira was simple but filling. Local liqueurs made from fermented fruits were really special.</p>

<h3>Transportation</h3>
<p>Hitchhiking was extremely difficult in Sintra given how touristy it was, however in Madeira we were able to do it twice. Transportation otherwise was fairly cheap but did not reach everywhere. Taxis were a more reliable alternative.</p>

<h3>People</h3>
<p>I think people of Madeira were friendly and helpful. It was easy to make good conversations despite that not everyone spoke fluent English.</p>

<h3>Special Experiences</h3>
<p>Staying hunkered in a tent at Pico Ruivo in the middle of a rainstorm. It was the worst camping night of my life. In Sintra we were invited to be part of the Easter celebrations at our Airbnb host's place. We cooked chicken for them and also helped them in making caramel. Overall it was a beautiful experience.</p>
