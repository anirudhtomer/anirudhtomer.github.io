<p>I was never a photographer, but I always enjoyed taking pictures. I started with a Sony Cybershot DSC-HV10V which I used from 2013 to 2019, and then I switched to a Sony RX100-VA from 2019 to 2020. Starting from 2021 I am using a mobile phone for my pictures and a DJI Mini 2 drone for aerial photos and aerial filmography. Below I have shared links and photo collages (favorite 4 per country) of the countries I have visited. When you click on link of the country, it should take you to a page where I have provided more photos from various hikes, along with descriptions of the country, its people, culture, food, and landscapes.</p>
