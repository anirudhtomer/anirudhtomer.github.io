<p>I have always been inspired by polymaths, albeit 'polymaths' in a less strict sense. For example, in my engineering school's second year, I came across a book titled <i>Advanced MS-DOS Programming</i> written by Ray Duncan. The author identified himself as someone who did a bachelor's in Chemistry, an MD in medicine, and subsequently wrote a book on MS-DOS. Irrespective of the book's content quality, it baffled me that someone could work in fairly non-overlapping scientific fields. Over time I realized that such people are not as rare as I thought them to be. However, the pressures of modern work culture and financial problems sometimes do not allow people to practice various fields. Nevertheless, I was a bit lucky to pursue my interests to some extent, and some of the projects I enjoyed doing are listed below.</p>

<h3> 2007 to 2011: Systems Programming </h3>
One of the interesting projects I did during my Bachelor degree in Computer Engineering was to transcode a video live-stream and to re-stream is simultaneously.

, I found Linux and systems programming quite enticing. At one point I thought this is all I want to do in my life. Thankfully, it did not turn out that way.

<h3> 2011 to 2014: Web development and UX design </h3>

<h3> 2016 to 2020: PhD research in Cancer Biostatistics and Biostatistics Consulting</h3>

<h3> 2020 to 2021: Epidemiology statistician for Vaccine development lifecycle </h3>
