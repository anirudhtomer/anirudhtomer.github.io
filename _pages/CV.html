<p>I have always been inspired by polymaths, albeit in a less strict sense. For example, in my engineering school's second year, I came across a book titled <i>Advanced MS-DOS Programming</i> written by Ray Duncan. The author identified himself as someone who did a bachelor's in Chemistry, an MD in medicine, and subsequently wrote a book on MS-DOS. Irrespective of the book's content quality, it baffled me that someone could work in fairly non-overlapping scientific fields. Over time I realized that such people are not as rare as I thought them to be. However, the pressures of modern work culture and financial problems sometimes do not allow people to practice various fields. Nevertheless, I was a bit lucky to pursue my interests to some extent. Although my work does not have as much variety as my inspirations, I have listed my projects below.</p>
