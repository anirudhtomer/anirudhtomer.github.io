'We are the sum total of experiences', and in this regard nothing has influenced my life more than the repetitive strain injury I went through in the year 2013-2014. The physical aspects of the injury ended my career as a software developer, something that was dear to me back then. Forced to find a new career, I decided to pursue further education in life sciences and mathematics because they involve much less typing work. Over time, and with good fortune I was able to combine my interests in life sciences and mathematics, and in 2020 I graduated with a PhD in Biostatistics at Erasmus University Rotterdam, the Netherlands. The injury also brought me closer to nature, and hiking/walking in nature in different countries brought me closer to food and cultures around this world. I enjoy all things outdoors, be it cycling, kayaking, walking, hiking, watching birds and (farm) animals, taking pictures of landscapes, or just pondering about life in general with a cup of black tea. I am quite passionate about cooking, and I can cook Indian, Italian, Greek, Mexican, Middle-eastern, Bolivian, Sichuan-chinese, and fusion food. Three to five times a year I visit big mountains, to marvel at the wonders of this nature, and to be away from big city life. Currently I am spending some time exploring drone filmography. Next I would like to spend some time doing vertical farming of herbs or greenhouse farming of flowers in India.
