My name is Anirudh Tomer. My first name means "unrestrained", "without obstacles" or "unstoppable", although as I learned in life that is never true :). Nevertheless the name has a fun [mythological story](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aniruddha) too. What's in a name anyway? I was born and raised in India, where I lived the first 24 years of my life. I then moved to Leuven, Belgium to study at KU Leuven, and subsequently to Rotterdam, the Netherlands to study at Erasmus University Rotterdam. I currently live with my lovely wife Nikhita in the beautiful town of Schiedam, the Netherlands next to a really lovely canal with old trading ships. 

For a living, I currently do statistics/machine learning and programming. My current favorite area in statistics/ML is time series analysis, followed by computer vision for medical images. I was fortunate to obtain a Ph.D. in (Bio) Statistics under the guidance of [Dimitris Rizopoulos](http://www.drizopoulos.com/) and [Ewout Steyerberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ewout_W._Steyerberg). I enjoy programming in dynamically typed languages, like Python, R, and JavaScript. Having said that, I often also detest sitting in front of a computer for a living. 

Outside work, my main fun activity is just being outdoors in nature. I enjoy cycling, kayaking, walking, hiking, watching birds and (farm) animals, taking pictures of landscapes, and just pondering about life in general with a cup of black tea. I am quite passionate about cooking, and I can cook Indian, Italian, Greek, Mexican, Middle-eastern, Sichuan-chinese, and fusion food. Three to five times a year I also visit big mountains, to marvel at the wonders of this nature, and to be away from big city life. I try not to rent a car and rely on public transport and hitchhiking. My most memorable trip so far was to the island of La Palma in Spain. I was fortunate to have visited Iceland twice and I really miss sitting in the sundlaug (hot water swimming pools) after a long hike with sore legs.
