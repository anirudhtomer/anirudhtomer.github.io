I made this website to share experiences I obtained in the limited amount of travel I was able to afford outside my commitments for work and family. I have also put my CV and publications in case someone with an interesting work opportunity for me finds this page. 

My short summary is that, I am from India, but since 2014 I have lived in Belgium and the Netherlands. The most important event in my life was the repetitive strain injury that took me years to rehabilitate from. It ended my career as a software developer, but brought me to the world of statistics and also closer to nature. I ended up doing PhD in Statistics with a focus on Cancer from Erasmus University Rotterdam, the Netherlands. The PhD was the most qualitative work time of my life, and I am indebted to my advisor Prof. dr. [Dimitris Rizopoulos](http://www.drizopoulos.com/) for that. While I am working as what they call a data/ML scientist 'for now', I would like to next spend some time doing vertical farming or greenhouse farming in India.

Outside work, I enjoy all things outdoors, be it cycling, kayaking, walking, hiking, watching birds and (farm) animals, taking pictures of landscapes, or just pondering about life in general with a cup of black tea. I am quite passionate about cooking, and I can cook Indian, Italian, Greek, Mexican, Middle-eastern, Sichuan-chinese, and fusion food. Three to five times a year I visit big mountains, to marvel at the wonders of this nature, and to be away from big city life.

Lastly, I hope you find something more interesting than what brought you here.
