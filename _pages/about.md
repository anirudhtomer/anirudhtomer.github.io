Dear reader,

How likely is it that out of the billions of web pages on the internet you chose mine to visit? Welcome. 

My aim to create this website was to share experiences I obtained in the limited amount of travel I was able to afford outside my commitments for work and family. Some are based on the fortunate times I shared with strangers and friends, and a few others are related to work. For now I have categorized them as scientific publications, stories, photography, cooking, and a few other miscellaneous things. Before I introduce myself, a fun fact I can tell you is that my name has an interesting Indian [mythological story](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aniruddha) associated with it. I grew up in India and lived there for the first 24 years of my life. Since then I have lived in Belgium and the Netherlands. I am extremely grateful to the Belgian people for allowing me to study for an MSc in Statistics, on a tuition fees cheaper than in India. My alma mater KU Leuven, also gave me the opportunity to switch careers from Computer Science to Statistics. I am indebted to [Dimitris](http://www.drizopoulos.com/) for giving me a chance to pursue a PhD under his guidance at ErasmusMC, Rotterdam. He gave me freedom to spend 4 years the way I wanted. Despite the amazing time I had with him, I decided that PhD was the end of my academic life, and I have now moved on to the industry. While I am working as a data scientist for now, next I would like to spend some time being a farmer and see if that is something for me.

Outside work, my main fun activity is being outdoors in nature and cooking. I enjoy cycling, kayaking, walking, hiking, watching birds and (farm) animals, taking pictures of landscapes, and just pondering about life in general with a cup of black tea. I am quite passionate about cooking, and I can cook Indian, Italian, Greek, Mexican, Middle-eastern, Sichuan-chinese, and fusion food. Three to five times a year I also visit big mountains, to marvel at the wonders of this nature, and to be away from big city life. In Europe, I would like to make my third visit to Iceland, a second visit to the island of La Palma, and a first visit to Lofoten. However, the place I want to visit the most is Concordia, on the way to the base camp of the second highest mountain in the world called K2, in Pakistan.

That's all about me in short. I hope you get joy from this website and perhaps find something more interesting than what brought you here.

My best wishes,
Anirudh
