I made this website to share experiences I obtained in the limited amount of travel I was able to afford outside my commitments for work and family. In addition I have put my CV and publications in case someone with an interesting work opportunity for me finds this page. I hope you find something more interesting than what brought you here.

My short summary is that, I am from India but since 2014 I have lived in Belgium and the Netherlands. I studied first studied computer science, and then statistics. I also obtained a PhD in Statistics from the Erasmus University Rotterdam, the Netherlands. The PhD was the most qualitative work time of my life, and I am indebted to my advisor Prof. dr. [Dimitris Rizopoulos](http://www.drizopoulos.com/) for that. While I am working as what they call a data/ML scientist 'for now', I would like to next spend some time doing vertical farming or greenhouse farming in India.

Outside work, I enjoy all things outdoors, be it cycling, kayaking, walking, hiking, watching birds and (farm) animals, taking pictures of landscapes, or just pondering about life in general with a cup of black tea. I am quite passionate about cooking, and I can cook Indian, Italian, Greek, Mexican, Middle-eastern, Sichuan-chinese, and fusion food. Three to five times a year I visit big mountains, to marvel at the wonders of this nature, and to be away from big city life.
