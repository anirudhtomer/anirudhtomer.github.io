How likely is it that out of the billions of web pages on the internet you chose mine to visit? Welcome. With this website I am sharing experiences I obtained in the limited amount of travel I was able to afford outside my commitments for work and family. In addition I have put my CV and publications in case someone with an interesting work opportunity for me finds this page. I hope you find something more interesting than what brought you here.

My short summary is that, I am from India but since 2014 I have lived in Belgium and the Netherlands. I studied Computer Science and Statistics. Although, I really detest sitting in front of computers. Although, in past I enjoyed sitting in front of a screen, especially during my PhD in statistics. My PhD was the most qualitative work time of my life, and I am indebted to my advisor Prof. dr. [Dimitris Rizopoulos](http://www.drizopoulos.com/) for that. Despite the amazing time I had with him, after the PhD I moved on to work in the industry. While I am working as what they call a data scientist 'for now', I would like to next spend some time doing vertical farming or greenhouse farming in my village in India.

Outside work, I enjoy cycling, kayaking, walking, hiking, watching birds and (farm) animals, taking pictures of landscapes, and just pondering about life in general with a cup of black tea. Actually I am quite passionate about cooking, and I can cook Indian, Italian, Greek, Mexican, Middle-eastern, Sichuan-chinese, and fusion food. Three to five times a year I also visit big mountains, to marvel at the wonders of this nature, and to be away from big city life. In Europe, I would like to make my third visit to Iceland, a second visit to the island of La Palma, and a first visit to Lofoten. However, the place I want to visit the most is Concordia, on the way to the base camp of the second highest mountain in the world called K2, in Pakistan.
