Dear reader,

How likely is it that out of the billions of web pages on the internet you chose mine to visit? Welcome. With this website I am sharing experiences I obtained in the limited amount of travel I was able to afford outside my commitments for work and family. In addition I have put my CV and publications in case someone with an interesting work opportunity for me finds this page. I hope you get joy from this website and perhaps find something more interesting than what brought you here.

My short summary is that, I am from India but since 2014 I have lived in Belgium and the Netherlands. I studied Computer Science and Statistics, but a secret I can tell you is that I detest screen time. Nevertheless, the most amazing time I had in front of a computer was my time during my PhD in statistics. For that I am indebted to my advisor Prof. dr. [Dimitris Rizopoulos](http://www.drizopoulos.com/) for giving me freedom to spend 4 years the way I wanted. Despite the amazing time I had with him, after the PhD I moved on to work in the industry. While I am working as a data scientist for now, next I would like to spend some time doing vertical farming or greenhouse farming in my village in India.

Outside work, my main fun activity is cooking and just being outdoors in nature. I enjoy cycling, kayaking, walking, hiking, watching birds and (farm) animals, taking pictures of landscapes, and just pondering about life in general with a cup of black tea. I am quite passionate about cooking, and I can cook Indian, Italian, Greek, Mexican, Middle-eastern, Sichuan-chinese, and fusion food. Three to five times a year I also visit big mountains, to marvel at the wonders of this nature, and to be away from big city life. In Europe, I would like to make my third visit to Iceland, a second visit to the island of La Palma, and a first visit to Lofoten. However, the place I want to visit the most is Concordia, on the way to the base camp of the second highest mountain in the world called K2, in Pakistan.

My best wishes,
Anirudh
