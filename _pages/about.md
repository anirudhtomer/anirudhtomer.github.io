> The longer I live, the more certain I am that there are no accidents in life. There are no chance meetings; everything happens according to a plan, regularly and in order.

*'We are the sum total of experiences'*, and in this regard, nothing has influenced my life more than the repetitive strain injury I went through in the year 2013-2014. The physical aspects of the injury ended my career as a software developer, dear to me back then. However, at the same time, it brought me closer to life sciences and mathematics, subjects that my father taught me outdoors with real-world examples and much enthusiasm. With good fortune, I was able to fulfill my desire to contribute to science on a high level, and in 2020 I graduated with a PhD in Biostatistics at Erasmus University Rotterdam, the Netherlands. I am grateful to life for bestowing me with a genuine interest in science and the natural world we live in. Currently, I work as a Biostatistician working with scientists involved in developing new vaccines for a variety of diseases.

The repetitive strain injury also brought me closer to nature, the night sky, and mountains in particular. Hiking/walking in nature in different countries brought me closer to food and cultures, religions, and communities in different parts of our beautiful world. I enjoy the outdoors in all forms, be it the cold wind hitting my face, the monsoon rain, or the first warm ray of sun through the clouds. When I get time for myself, I enjoy cycling, kayaking, walking, hiking, watching birds and (farm) animals, taking pictures of landscapes, or just pondering about life in general with a cup of black tea. I am quite passionate about cooking. I can cook Indian, Italian, Greek, Mexican, Middle-eastern, Bolivian, Sichuan-Chinese, and fusion food. Three to five times a year, I also visit big mountains, marvel at the wonders of this nature, and enjoy being away from big city life. Currently, I am spending some time exploring drone filmography. In the next few years, I would like to spend some time doing indoor farming of vegetables in my village in India.
